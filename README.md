> clear.

Techscriptor helps you avoid the following:

* **Long sentences:** Make your sentences short and clear.
* **Passive voice:** Use the active voice most of the time.
* **Generic expressions:** Reduce imprecise, weak, or generic words.
* **Adverbs:** Avoid adverbs if they add no significant meaning.

repository to your local machine.

Techscriptor loads its dependencies from CDNs (see below). Other than that, it
loads `ts.min.js` which is the minified[^1] version of `js/techscriptor.js`.
